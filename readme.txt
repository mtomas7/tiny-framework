== Description ==
Tiny Framework WordPress theme was created with the future in mind and encompasses all the best features of the default WordPress themes in one place, adds full accessibility and Structured Data Markup with Schema.org microdata format support. Fast start is ensured with very extensive documentation!

Tiny Framework features elegant responsive mobile-first design, HTML5 ready structure of Underscores, custom per-post headers, custom logo, three footer widgets, FontAwesome icon webfont and Google Fonts support. Web developers will enjoy integrated Theme Hook Alliance custom action hooks. It's all there, you have everything in one neat package.

Tiny Framework can be used as a learning tool or your own little web development "framework" a.k.a. "starter theme". With its unique "Coding Tips System" Tiny Framework helps to understand how to extend parent themes and build your own child themes, hacking them the way you want. Along with the main theme you will find an example of a child theme - an easy way to start developing with child themes! You get the best coding examples from default WordPress themes and the best hacks from the child theme.

Full overview of Tiny Framework theme
-------------------------------------

http://mtomas.com/1/


Quick start guide
=================

1. The way WordPress works, each time you update a theme, its folder would be overwritten with new version. That means if you want to make changes to the theme and retain them, you have two choices: use a custom CSS plugin, where you would store all new CSS styles, or use a child theme, that you would modify.

First choice is good for users who will do only small changes, that can be achieved by modifying CSS styles. In this case you would append new CSS styles with the help of a plugin. If you're using popular Jetpack plugin suite, it has a Custom CSS module, other plugins to consider:

	https://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-custom-css/

	https://wordpress.org/plugins/imporved-simpler-css/

With the arrival of new theme version, you could update theme, because all your custom CSS styles would be safely stored in the database.

If you plan to make more considerable changes to the theme, I would suggest using a child theme. New WordPress users do not know how to create a child theme,
for that purpose I included an example of a child theme with main Tiny Framework download under inc/examples/tiny-framework-child.

To install child theme, upload this child theme as a separate theme alongside with Tiny Framework parent theme (both themes should be uploaded for child theme to work).

Activate Child theme and you're ready to go! From that point all of your changes will be done in the child theme. If you need to modify a file, but it isn't present in your child theme's folder, just copy it there from the Tiny Framework theme.

As a bonus, Tiny Framework child theme has very nice search field in the top menu area (ported from Twenty Thirteen theme), support for Overhanging/Pull Quotes and Overhanging Images. Two new header images were added to give you an example on how to change the default header images in the child theme.
To activate search field you have to create a menu and assign it as primary (see Step 3).

Read more about child themes:

https://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes


2. In WordPress Admin panel go to Admin Panel Menu > Appearance > Widgets, expand Footer Copyright Widget Area on the right side,
drag a standard Text widget from the left side to the widget area, enter your copyright text in the text field
(leave the title field empty):

	`
	&copy; 2015 Your Name. All rights reserved
	`

	P.S. please do not copy backticks - they are here to make this document compatible with Markdown syntax.


3. Go to Theme Customizer (Admin Panel Menu > Appearance > Customize) and see if you need to change any visual aspects of your site.

	- If you already created menu, assign it as primary in Navigation. You can also create a menu and assign it as primary in:

		Admin. panel > Appearance > Menus

		At the top see: "Select a menu to edit, or create a new menu." and create a menu if it's a fresh WordPress install. Then at the bottom check "Theme locations: Primary Menu" and save the menu.

	- If you will choose to upload custom logo (display it next to Site Title and Description), I recommend to size its height to 85px.


4. Setup menu for social icons. First method (an easy one) is to create new menu, name it "Social" or other name and assign it as "Social Links Menu" (the check box at the bottom).
Then you can add your social profiles as Links. By default social icons would be displayed on the right side of the footer.

If you want to use icon webfont for social networks in widgets and other places, use standard text widget in the Main Sidebar Widget (same instructions as with Footer Copyright Widget) with text like this:

	```
	<a href="http://address-to-about-me-page" class="icon-webfont social-link fa-pencil"><span class="screen-reader-text">Contact me</span></a>
	<a href="http://address-to-facebook-account" class="icon-webfont social-link fa-facebook-square"><span class="screen-reader-text">Facebook</span></a>
	<a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/your-profile/" class="icon-webfont social-link fa-linkedin-square"><span class="screen-reader-text">LinkedIn</span></a>
	<a href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/your-wp-name" class="icon-webfont social-link fa-wordpress"><span class="screen-reader-text">WordPress.org</span></a>
	<a href="http://twitter.com/your-twitter-handle" class="icon-webfont social-link fa-twitter"><span class="screen-reader-text">Twitter</span></a>
	<a href="https://plus.google.com/your-g-plus-account-number" class="icon-webfont social-link fa-google-plus-square" rel="author"><span class="screen-reader-text">Google+</span></a>
	<a href="http://github.com/your-github-name" class="icon-webfont social-link fa-github"><span class="screen-reader-text">Github</span></a>
	```

	P.S. please do not copy backticks - they are here to make this document compatible with Markdown syntax.


5. Next, open functions.php file in a text editor and find sections:

	- 6.0 (2.2 in child themes) - Add optional meta tags, scripts to head

	- 9.0 (1.4 in child themes) - Footer credits - Tip87 - Action Hook implementation example

	- 10.0 (3.0 in child themes) - Functions to optimize performance

	- 11.0 (4.0 in child themes) - Functions to increase security

	- 12.0 (5.0 in child themes) - Other functions

Check if you need to enable (uncomment) any of the functions there. If you enabled human.txt meta tag, open human.txt file in text editor and update it with your information.


6. Make it look clean (optional). Personally I'm not a fan of displaying a bunch of meta data on index page or on archive pages. I try to keep it as clean as possible
to not mess with readers attention. But I had to enable all that meta info to pass theme evaluation. However it is very easy to fix it. To disable entry meta, located below the post in index/archive view, open style.css file in a text editor
and search for Tip30, then uncomment next CSS block to hide entry meta section (with author, categories, tags) in the Index page and archive listings.


7. If you want to use custom logo, there are two usage cases:

- Your self-hosted site runs WordPress 4.5 or newer version or site is hosted at WordPress.com.

- If you have self-hosted site that runs older WordPress version, you have to install Jetpack plugin.

Then go to Customizer and under Site Title & Tagline you can upload an image to use it as custom logo.

8. Maintain fully accessible website (recommended). As you probably noticed, accessible WordPress themes have special "accessibility-ready" tag.
	It basically means that this theme produces accessible website on clean WordPress installation. It also means, that after some user actions website might not be fully accessible anymore.
	That's right, website owners can negatively affect accessibility of their own websites. Here are several precautions and tips to keep your website accessible.

- Headings play a big role in providing web accessibility and can have potential impact for website's SEO ( https://www.joedolson.com/2014/11/headings-hierarchy-problem/ ).
	Knowing that, users should use headings in their produced content following main heading structure of a theme.

	H1 is reserved to describe one most important item on a page, usually post/page title. H2 is used to outline main website document structure
	and H3 is used to describe less important page elements, like widgets, etc.

	Tiny Framework users should use headings in posts and pages starting from H2, and starting from H4 for the content inside the widgets.

- Use headings in a consistent manner, don't skip or mix them up, eg. H2-->H3-->H4, but not H2-->H4-->H3.
	Basically, you have to start with highest heading (H2 for content and H4 for widgets) and then use lower importance headings if needed.
	If you would think that visually lower importance heading, eg. H4 looks better, you would not use H4 after H2, but instead you would alter
	the CSS style of H3 to match your needs. This would give you the desired look and would not break the logical structure of a document.

- If you will decide to change color and/or background of text elements, always check if new color combination conforms to web accessibility requirements: http://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/  This requirement is also valid for the states of a text or link: :hover, :focus, :active, :visited.

- If you upload images that add value to the content, please do not forget to provide Title description and/or Alt Text description in media uploader. If Alt Text field of media uploader is empty, WordPress will use Title field instead. So at least one of the fields should be provided.

- Theme documentation time investment: ~0 h and stopped counting somewhere down the road...

### Added
- Added security option to functions.php of the child theme: Disable XML-RPC service.
- Added SASS support. I decided not to replicate whole CSS styles in SASS, but use SASS as a staging step to make easier the customization of a child theme, especially font sizes, colors, etc. - things that are also marked in style.css with Tip88.

	https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/43051#file17

= 2.3.0 =
- Released: 2017-01-21
----------------------

### Release info
- Release time investment (Development & QA): ~11 h and stopped counting somewhere down the road...
- Free theme support time investment: ~2 h and stopped counting somewhere down the road...
- Theme documentation time investment: ~3 h and stopped counting somewhere down the road...

### Added
- Added Post Type Template support. Decided not to add back-compatibility as I will not include any additional templates that would be only for posts.
	Currently I enabled Full-width page template for posts (might be useful for landing pages, etc.). For more info about this feature and back-compatibility see:
	https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/11/03/post-type-templates-in-4-7/
	https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/18375
- Added: Persist Admin notice Dismissals to handle the WP Admin Panel notice:
	https://github.com/collizo4sky/persist-admin-notices-dismissal
	http://w3guy.com/wordpress-admin-notices-dismissible/
	via: https://wordpress.stackexchange.com/a/193573
- Added a class of .group-blog to blogs with more than 1 published author.
- Added a class of .title-tagline-hidden if the site title and tagline is hidden.
- Added support for customizer edit shortcuts. You can see them next to site title, description, logo and widgets in the customizer preview (WordPress version 4.7 required).
- Tip91 - Set Next and Previous post links to be from the same category (taxonomy) as current post (single.php).
- Translation: added Portuguese (Português) translation. Big thanks to Pedro Mendonça!

### Removed
- Translation: by using standard comment navigation we can remove 3 strings:
	Comment navigation
	Older comments
	Newer comments
- Removed nav id="comment-nav-below" - standard comment navigation doesn't use it.

### Fixed
- Persistent Admin Panel notice on theme activation/update.

### Changed
- Dependency update: updated Font Awesome 4.6.3 --> 4.7.0.
- Minimum WordPress version requirement raised 4.1 --> 4.4. Stats show that WordPress 4.1 is used only by 3.3%, WordPress 4.2 only by 4.3% and WordPress 4.3 only by 5.1% of the sites (combined only 12.7%), so I hope incompatibility impact will be minimal.
	On the other hand it will help the theme evolve together with WordPress.
	https://wordpress.org/about/stats/
- Replaced custom comments nav with WordPress built-in (via Twenty Sixteen).
	https://github.com/WordPress/twentysixteen/commit/736553e48ec64e6890b92f20e853ba171546a8bb
- Moved HTML5 Shiv code from header.php to functions.php by using wp_script_add_data.

	https://github.com/Automattic/_s/commit/33a777556fadf3350131b95338c51df2f88da583
- Updated js/navigation.js (via Underscores).
	https://github.com/Automattic/_s/commit/e38cfc29bca6d414393f3aa16303f8f6a7ea5b0e
- Updated tinyframework_pingback_header function in inc/template-tags.php (via Underscores).

= 2.2.1 =
- Released: 2016-10-23

### Release info
- Release time investment (Development & QA): ~3 h and stopped counting somewhere down the road...
- Free theme support time investment: ~1 h and stopped counting somewhere down the road...

### Added
- Added preconnect for Google Fonts to functions.php (via Twenty Fifteen).
	https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/38870/trunk/src/wp-content/themes/twentyfifteen

### Removed
- Tip36 - Display featured image thumbnail in archive views (index page, categories, etc.) This tip was superseded with Tip40 - Displays an optional post thumbnail (Featured Image) on index views.
- Translation: removed local translation files and support for them, all translations migrated to WordPress.org (via Twenty Twelve).
	https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/38093/trunk/src/wp-content/themes/twentytwelve
	https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-themes/tiny-framework
Removed author meta info from parent and child themes that had to be used to show the web project author. But Facebook uses this info to show article author, so we don't want any confusion and legal/attribution issues. In functions.php line was"
	echo '<meta name="author" content="Your name here">'; echo "\n\n";

### Changed
- Dependency update: updated normalize.css 4.2.0 --> 5.0.0.
- Enhancement: improved Schema.org support by enabling photo and u-photo classes for the featured header image. Big thanks to @wido for the provided work-around:
	https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/36996#comment:3
- Enhancement: moved pingback code from header.php to inc/template-tags.php (via Underscores).
	https://github.com/Automattic/_s/commit/ff4b374d6bf289eb602e9cebba369077dd446050
- Enhancement: updated inc/admin-notice.php code to use new classes .notice and .is-dismissible:
	https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/04/23/spinners-and-dismissible-admin-notices-in-4-2/
	https://digwp.com/2016/05/wordpress-admin-notices/

= 2.2.0 =
- Released: 2016-08-06
----------------------

### Release info
- Release time investment (Development & QA): ~45 h and stopped counting somewhere down the road...
- Free theme support time investment: ~16 h and stopped counting somewhere down the road...
- Theme documentation time investment: ~2 h and stopped counting somewhere down the road...

### Added
- Translation: completed French (Français) translation. Big thanks to Alex Goudeau and James Capra!

- Tip40 - Optional post thumbnail (Featured Image) on index views (style.css, inc/template-tags.php , template-parts/content.php) (can also be used in child themes) (via Twenty Sixteen).
	This option is enabled by default in a child theme example - too good to leave it disabled!
- Tip41 - Display the optional entry excerpt (subtitle) below the entry title.
	It is implemented as in Twenty Sixteen.
	Includes a fix for better plugin compatibility: https://github.com/WordPress/twentysixteen/issues/397
- Tip85b - Add Social Links Menu to header (optional) (functions.php, style.css) (only in child themes).
- Tip89 - Add custom image sizes to the editor (functions.php) (also in child themes).
- Tip90 - Fine-tune Schema.org markup (inc/semantics.php).
- Added new file inc/semantics.php to and new functions and to collect all related functions from functions.php and template-tags.php.
- Enhancing microformats support and adding microformats v2 support (via SemPress).
	https://github.com/pfefferle/SemPress/blob/master/sempress/inc/semantics.php
	https://github.com/pfefferle/SemPress/blob/master/sempress/functions.php
- Added to functions.php new functions, based on plugin 'Disable Emojis' to improve site performance (disabled by default) (only in child themes).
- Added new social network icons for odnoklassniki.ru and getpocket.com.
- Added new HTML5 input types to the comment-form (via SemPress).
- Added for the Fancy Header child theme CSS rules to relocate the whole branding block to the left side, search style.css for: "Move the branding block to the left side".
- Indicate widget sidebars can use selective refresh in the Customizer (via Twenty Twelve).
	https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/37040/trunk/src/wp-content/themes/twentytwelve/functions.php

### Removed
- Tip02 - Optional code to enable favicon for the website, admin area and login page. It was done, because now Site Icon can be set in WordPress.
- Removed non-standard and deprecated webkit CSS rule 'word-break: break-word' that also caused some problems on Arabic RTL sites.
	https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!msg/chromium-discuss/ZmGeuW9Y1uY/IsfdwkbFCQAJ
	https://wordpress.org/support/topic/various-items-including-p-ul-ol-and-related-lis-have-added-tabs-and-spaces?replies=8
- Removed some functions from parent theme's functions.php that were disabled by default.
- Removed CSS class for post .has-thumbnail in favor of one that already was present in the theme: .has-post-thumbnail.
- Removed itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="https://schema.org/WPHeader" from the div.site-branding as it was duplicate from header. I'm not sure why I did this way before.

### Fixed
- Changed the global value in functions.php for content_width 640 -> 625 because that is current content width, I guess the old value came from the Twenty Twelve theme where sidebar was narrower.
- Fixed Schema.org issue placing "name" inside "Person".
- Escaped attribute text properly in 'aria-label' attributes (via Twenty Sixteen).
	https://github.com/WordPress/twentysixteen/commit/6a5704a45a1da24ba2c2b9b9c165b4611bf06a55
- Fixed menu bug where menu would be incorrectly rendered when enlarging browser window with expanded mobile menu.
	To fix this, additional media query was introduced: @media screen and (max-width: 782px).
	If you're using a child theme, please see Child theme example that is included with the main theme, to see what changes you have to make in style.css.
- Fixed a bunch of small CSS errors.
- Fixed function tinyframework_tax_body_class that was not adding category names to a post BODY classes.
- Added conditional for tinyframework_page_slug_body_class function, so the post/page slug would not be added to category and other archive pages.
- Enabled touch support for nav menu links with sub-items (via Underscores).
	https://github.com/Automattic/_s/issues/957#issuecomment-221962311
	https://github.com/Automattic/_s/pull/963

### Changed
- Dependency update: updated normalize.css to 4.2.0.
- Dependency update: updated Font Awesome 4.3.0 --> 4.6.3.
- Dependency update: updated related CSS styles to Bootstrap 3.3.7.
- IMPORTANT! Enhancement: changed the text domain from tinyframework --> tiny-framework. If you use a child theme in another language, you need to check child theme's files and replace all 'tinyframework' instances with 'tiny-framework' in order for the translated lines to appear.
	I understand, that this change will cause problems to some users, but WordPress.org theme review team basically forced me to do this, please see the announcement post: http://mtomas.com/709/announcing-accessible-wordpress-theme-tiny-framework-2-2
- IMPORTANT! Enhancement: moved custom logo function from inc/plugin-compatibility.php to functions.php as in WordPress 4.5 it became part of the core. After your site will be upgraded to WordPress 4.5 or newer, you can uninstall old Site Logo plugin if you're using it, or Jetpack plugin if you are using it only to get custom site logo feature.
	Because new WordPress custom logo function uses different CSS classes, old child themes have to change old classes to new ones:
	.has-site-logo --> .wp-custom-logo (new theme version includes back-compat. function and CSS styles)
	.site-logo-link --> .custom-logo-link (new theme version includes back-compat. function and CSS styles)
	.site-logo --> .custom-logo (no back-compat. styles, old class is replaced by new one)
- Enhancement: additional functions were added to template-tags.php to deal with the Site Logo migration to WP Custom Logo. See the section "Temporary and deprecated functions" at the end of the file.
- Enhancement: made function tinyframework_the_site_logo replaceable in a child theme.
- Enhancement: Custom Logo Optimisation. Bring custom-logo args closer to custom-header.

	https://github.com/WordPress/twentysixteen/commit/ba08079cd0795c05b3d955893a0c8156f7c1c0ad

	https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/33418/trunk/src/wp-content/themes/twentyfifteen/css/editor-style.css
- Enhancement: updated h2.entry-title code in content.php adding esc_url (via Underscores).

	https://github.com/WordPress/twentysixteen/commit/78109b6b50959fcaf89dd7ef2b63ffa579c409df
- Enhancement: removed some unnecessary browser specific CSS prefixes (via html5please.com).
- Enhancement: improved bottom margin for .post-navigation links. This was especially visible in posts with disabled comments.
- Enhancement: many Schema.org integration improvements.
- Enhancement: changed the class for Sidebar from .secondary --> .sidebar, as Sidebar already has ID #secondary (via Twenty Sixteen).
	https://github.com/WordPress/twentysixteen/commit/f58ea91328162c8eb39d993553402952c3cc21fb

- Enhancement: updated navigation.js and skip-link-focus-fix.js (via Underscores).
	https://github.com/Automattic/_s/commit/6ae11474be9dc76404c15f5d1b752059d3ad52c4
- Enhancement: improved mobile menu - menu item now shows special icon if it contains submenu.

	https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/36797
- Enhancement: added itemprop="mainEntityOfPage" after post/page title for single pages/posts as link element. HTML5 specification says that link should be inside HEAD, but it looks that
	at the moment it is a workaround to pass Google's microdata validation:
	http://www.seoskeptic.com/how-to-use-schema-org-v2-0s-mainentityofpage-property/
	Update: replaced it with meta (and url as ID) as per Google recommendation:
	https://developers.google.com/structured-data/rich-snippets/articles#article_markup_properties

- Enhancement: back-compat.php was renamed to back-compat-wp-4-1.php.
- Enhancement: removed content-box box-sizing on search fields (via Underscores).
	https://github.com/Automattic/_s/commit/7304cc1414ab28a9b300a8a7561d950c2bd7623d
	 This might slightly affect child themes.
	 If you see slightly smaller search field, remove all Tip10 CSS rules from your child theme's style.css or set the height to 30px:

	.site-header .search-form [type="search"],
	.site-header .search-form [type="text"] {
		height: 30px;
	}

	In the Full Width child theme you may need to decrease top margin of the top search box by about 3px in 1100px media query:

	.menu-item.menu-item-search {
		margin: 5px 7px 0 0;
		margin: 0.3125rem 0.4375rem 0 0;
	}

- Enhancement: added CSS rules to avoid overflowing wide custom logo in small screens in Firefox and IEs (via Twenty Sixteen).

	https://github.com/WordPress/twentysixteen/commit/4a7578c6aa5490abcbfa7e1bfa201176b27a95f0
- Accessibility: do not show the outline on the skip link target container (via Underscores).
	https://github.com/Automattic/_s/commit/1a7cedc7dd25d29e53d59b2004b8536de431326c
- Accessibility: changed the article text from justified to left-aligned to improve accessibility for the dyslexic users:
	http://uxmovement.com/content/6-surprising-bad-practices-that-hurt-dyslexic-users/
- Accessibility: I take a little step back from the Site Title update in v2.0.3 and wrap Site Title on the Front Page in the link as it is on all other pages. That creates a page link to itself, but simplifies code in many places and mirrors Underscores theme.
- Accessibility: While upgrading Bootstrap 3.3.6 --> 3.3.7 it came to light that it is better to remove forced outline: thin dotted; and leave it up to the browsers:
	https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/pull/19935
- Translation: updated Russian translation. Big thanks to Sergei Kasaurov!
- Translation: to improve i18n support: '...continue reading %s' changed to => '...continue reading<span class="screen-reader-text"> "%s"</span>' (via Twenty Sixteen).

	It will give clean outline and structure, good for semantics, assistive technology and search engines, see:

	to

	<button class="menu-toggle"><?php _e( 'Menu', 'tiny-framework' ); ?></button>
